## How to run the code

The folder with the scripts must comprise a folder named `Dataset` containing the `.mat` file with the channel measurements.

The file `main.py` runs the experiments:
```
python3 main.py --noisy True --noise_type symm --noise_rate 0.1 
```
where "noisy" must be set to True to run the tests in the presence of label noise. "noise_type" can be: "symm" for symmetric noise, "sparse" for sparse noise, and "unif" for uniform noise. "noise_rate" must be a float with suggested values: 0.1, 0.2. 

The scripts `main_functions.py` and `utils.py` define the functions needed in `main.py`.
